# AGENT.md — spelunk-powered project

## Context retrieval — use spelunk

This project is indexed with [spelunk](https://github.com/usercise/spelunk).
Before reading files directly, search the index — it's faster and surfaces
semantically relevant code that grep would miss.

```bash
# Find code by meaning
spelunk search "how does authentication work"
spelunk search "database connection pooling"

# Trace a symbol's callers and callees
spelunk graph verify_token

# Ask a natural language question (requires a local LLM)
spelunk ask "what does the retry logic do when the upstream times out?"

# List what's indexed
spelunk status
spelunk plumbing ls-files
```

**Rule:** run `spelunk search "<topic>"` before opening any file you haven't
already read this session. Only fall back to `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` when the
search returns nothing useful.

## Recorded decisions and context

Past architectural decisions, requirements, and open questions are stored in
spelunk memory. Check them at the start of every session:

```bash
spelunk memory list --kind decision --limit 10   # prior design decisions
spelunk memory list --kind handoff --limit 3     # where last session left off
spelunk memory list --kind question              # open questions
spelunk memory search "topic you care about"    # semantic search over memory
```

Store new decisions as you make them — don't wait until the end:

```bash
spelunk memory add --kind decision \
  --title "Why we use X instead of Y" \
  --body "reason, alternatives considered, what breaks if changed"

spelunk memory add --kind requirement \
  --title "Must support offline mode" \
  --body "user stated this as hard requirement on 2026-04-01"
```

## Plumbing commands (for scripting and pipelines)

spelunk exposes machine-readable plumbing commands for use in scripts:

```bash
# Stream all indexed chunks for a file as NDJSON
spelunk plumbing cat-chunks src/auth.rs

# Parse a file and emit AST chunks without writing to the DB
spelunk plumbing parse-file src/auth.rs

# Embed text and pipe into vector search
echo "token refresh flow" | spelunk plumbing embed --query \
  | spelunk plumbing knn --limit 5

# Check if a file has changed since last index
spelunk plumbing hash-file src/auth.rs

# Stream raw graph edges for a symbol
spelunk plumbing graph-edges --symbol verify_token
```

All plumbing commands emit NDJSON. Exit 0 = results, 1 = no results, 2 = error.

---

## Re-indexing

spelunk indexes are incremental. Re-run after significant changes:

```bash
spelunk index .            # index the current directory
spelunk check              # verify the index is fresh
```

A pre-commit hook can do this automatically — see `spelunk hooks install`.

## Project-specific notes

<!-- Customise this section for your project -->

**Tech stack:** <!-- e.g. Rust, PostgreSQL, React -->  
**Key entry points:** <!-- e.g. src/main.rs, src/api/routes.rs -->  
**Test command:** <!-- e.g. cargo test / pytest / npm test -->  
**Build command:** <!-- e.g. cargo build --release -->

## What spelunk cannot do

- It cannot run your tests or build the project — use shell commands for that
- Search results are only as fresh as the last `spelunk index` run
- `spelunk ask` requires a local LLM server at `http://127.0.0.1:1234`
  (configurable via `~/.config/spelunk/config.toml`)
